This is a tracker example designed for SIM808 over Arduino Mega. 
Please note that this example will not function with Arduino Uno due to the absence of hardware serial. 
The example operates in PDU mode and includes a debug mode which can be adjusted for text mode as well. 
Additionally, it is compatible with ESP32. We plan to update it in the future to support Arduino Uno and ESP8266.
